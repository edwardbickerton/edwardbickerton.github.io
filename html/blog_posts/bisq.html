      <h2>How Bisq works</h2>
      <p>
        During a trade both parties have to pay a security deposit (this ensures
        everyone acts honestly), all trade funds (deposits, trade amount and
        fees) are sent to a 2 of 2 multisig escrow with each party holding one
        of the keys, this means in order to move bitcoin from this multisig both
        parties need to sign the transaction i.e both parties need to agree on
        the payout of the trade. A signed transaction which sends all funds in
        the multisig to the Bisq donation address is signed which can only be
        published after 20 days for fiat trades.
      </p>

        style="position: relative; left: 50px; width: 50%"
      />
      <p>
        If a trade isn't going as it should you can message your counter-party
        and if things don't get resolved before the end of the trade period (1
        day for Faster Payments) a mediator will suggest a payout, and if things
        still aren't resolved you can publish the time-locked transaction and go
        to arbitration. More on dispute resolution can be found
        <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Dispute_resolution" target="_blank">here</a>.

      <h2>Why use Bisq</h2>
      <p>
        Bisq is a P2P (peer to peer) decentralized exchange, this means when you
        buy or sell bitcoin you interact directly with the person on the other
        side of the trade. The main benefit of this in my mind is privacy: you
        do not need to go through any KYC (know your customer) as you would with
        centralized exchanges such as coinbase or binance and all of your
        personal data is stored locally on your own computer. Another plus is
        security, you always hold your own keys so you are not exposed to
        <a
          href="https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-hacks/"
          target="_blank"
          >exchange hacks</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is bitcoin privacy important? Firstly because it involves sensitive
        financial information but especially because transactions are stored in
        a public and <strong>immutable</strong> ledger. Anyone with an internet
        connection can see the inputs, outputs and the amounts of any
        <a
          href="https://mempool.space/tx/430c23c244fc399660b7b1c2d612d6b4029bbd28ab71e23325657256f0352145"
          target="_blank"
          >onchain transaction</a
        >, (a great reason to use off chain layer 2 solutions like
        <a>lightning</a> or <a>liquid</a>) and while this ledger is
        pseudonymous, when paired with data from KYC exchanges, companies like
        <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com" target="_blank">chainalysis</a>
        can track your bitcoin transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe in bitcoin you should expect this ledger to outlive you.
        So if you mess up your onchain privacy there is nothing you can do to
        undo your mistake (you can use
        <a href="https://www.samouraiwallet.com/whirlpool" target="_blank"
          >coinjoin</a
        >
        to get forward privacy however). What if your government decides to
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102"
          target="_blank"
          >seize</a
        >
        bitcoins? While the digital nature of bitcoin can make it very hard to
        seize if
        <a href="https://btcguide.github.io" target="_blank">secured properly</a
        >, no one wants to be on the run from a powerful entity such as a
        government. This might sound very far-fetched and will hopefully never
        happen in your lifetime, but what about your heirs' lifetime?

      <h2>How to guid</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><h3>Getting Bisq</h3></li>
        <p>
          First go to
          <a href="https://bisq.network/downloads/" target="_blank"
            >https://bisq.network/downloads/</a
          >
          and download the corresponding files for your computer, this guide was
          done on a mac so I'll download the .dmg file and the corresponding PGP
          signature.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq1.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>
          The next few steps are to ensure that the .dmg file is authentic. Open
          the terminal app and run (copy and paste the following line into the
          terminal window and hit enter)
        </p>
        <p class="code">
          ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL
          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        </p>
        <p>
          hit enter, type your password if prompted and wait for homebrew to
          install.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq2.png" class="terminal" />
        <p>
          If you get the warning message /opt/homebrew/bin is not in your path
          follow the instructions under "Next steps". Then run the two lines
          separately
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq3.png" class="terminal" />
        <p class="code">brew install gnupg</p>
        <p class="code">
          curl https://bisq.network/pubkey/29CDFD3B.asc | gpg --import
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq4.png" class="terminal" />
        <p>
          The previous command imports the public key of Christoph Attender
          (ripcurlx). His public key ID is 29CDFD3B and fingerprint is CB36 D7D2
          EBB2 E35D 9B75 500B CD5D C1C5 29CD FD3B, which you can verify through
          <a
            href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/commits?author=ripcurlx"
            target="_blank"
            >commits on github</a
          >
          and on
          <a href="https://keybase.io/ripcurlx" target="_blank">keybase</a>, now
          run
        </p>
        <p class="code">cd Downloads</p>
        <p class="code">gpg --digest-algo SHA256 --verify Bisq-1.7.3.dmg.asc</p>
        <p>
          replacing Bisq-1.7.3.dmg.asc with the file name of the .asc file you
          downloaded.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq5.png" class="terminal" />
        <p>
          If all is well you should get a message similar to the one above,
          check that the key fingerprint is correct. Congratulations you have
          verified that the .dmg file you downloaded is authentic and it is safe
          to open it, and install Bisq.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq6.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>
          If you are using a newer m1 mac when you open bisq for the first time
          you may be prompted to install Rosetta if you have not done so before.
          If you get a message:"Bisq" can't be opened because it was not
          downloaded from the App Store, open system preferences and go to
          security and privacy and hit open anyway. You have now installed bisq,
          you can now eject the bisq volume and delete the .dmg and .asc files.

        </div>
        <li><h3>Getting started with Bisq</h3></li>
        <p>
          The first time you open Bisq you should be greeted by a screen like
          this
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq10.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>Before you make a trade there are several things you should do:</p>
        <p>Set a strong password</p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq11.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>
          Write down your wallets seed words, these words give access to any
          funds in your Bisq wallet so keep it secure
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq12.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>
          Create a payment account (faster payments is a popular payment method
          in the uk)
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq13.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>Backup Bisq, this should be done regularly</p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq14.png" class="screenshot" />
        <li><h3>Making a trade</h3></li>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq15.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>
          You are now ready to make a trade, you can either take an existing
          offer or create a new offer, the maker fees are 0.1% and the taker
          fees are 0.7%. When creating an offer you can set a percentage to
          deviate from the current market price, so it often pays to be patient
          and create your own offer.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq16.png" class="screenshot" />
        <br />
        <img src="/images/bisq/bisq17.png" class="screenshot" />
        <p>
          As you can see from the images above you need to "Fund your offer",
          this is to pay for the trading fee and the security deposit (more on
          this later). This is awkward as you need bitcoin to be able to buy
          bitcoin, you could buy some bitcoin off a friend or use a
